# Vaisala CL61 Ceilometer Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is a master's student project aimed at analyzing and processing data collected from a Vaisala CL61 ceilometer. The project focuses on understanding and interpreting atmospheric data for various applications, such as weather monitoring, climate research, or environmental studies.

## Project Goals

- Understand and interpret data from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer.

- Develop a Python module for data analysis and processing.

- Generate meaningful insights and visualizations from the data.

- Create a structured project that facilitates further research and experimentation.

## Project Structure

The project folder is structured as follows:

- `CL61_module/`: This directory contains the Python module responsible for processing and analyzing data from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer. It includes relevant configuration files and module-specific code.

- `Data_samples/`: Sample of data obtained from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer are stored here. These data files are used as input for analysis and processing in the Python module.

- `Outputs/`: Output files generated by the analysis process are saved here. This can include visualizations, reports, and processed data for further use.

- `tests/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts used for testing and analyzing the module's functionality. It serves as a workspace for experimentation and research.

## Module Structure

The module is organized into classes that handle different aspects of data processing and visualization. Here's an overview of the main classes:

### `CL61Processor`

The `CL61Processor` class is the core of the module which wraps around the loading of the dataset and manage the processing. It has three main subclasses, each accessible through different methods.

#### Subclasses

1. **Plotting (`.plot`):**
    - The `Plotting` subclass handles the generation of plots based on processed data.
    - Example usage:
      ```python
      cl61_processor = CL61Processor(...)
      cl61_processor.plot.show_timeserie()
      ```

2. **Noise Processing (`.process_noise`):**
    - The `NoiseProcessing` subclass focuses on noise processing within the data.
    - Example usage:
      ```python
      cl61_processor = CL61Processor(...)
      cl61_processor.process_noise.mask_noise()
      ```

3. **Classification (`.classification`):**
    - The `Classification` subclass is responsible for data classification (clustering and classification)
    - Example usage:
      ```python
      cl61_processor = CL61Processor(...)
      cl61_processor.classification.Kmeans_clustering()
      ```

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Explore the `CL61_module/` directory to understand the module's functionality and configuration.

4. ### Data Analysis and Processing
    Two options are suggested:

   a) Follow the proposed usage presented in the jupyter notebook scripts `main_analysis.ipynb` for dataset stored in local folder or on server. More usage examples are given in the `tests/` directory (see f.ex. `tests/main_paper_results.ipynb`)

    The basic use is with the following example:
    ```python
    import CL61_module as mCL61
    start_data = '2023-02-22 00:00:00'
    end_data = '2023-02-23 00:00:00'
    data_folder = "/path/to/your/data"

    feb22 = mCL61.CL61Processor(folder_path=data_folder,
                                     start_datetime=start_data, end_datetime=end_data,
                                     load_to_memory=False, transfer_files_locally=False)
    
    #automated processing:
    feb22.auto_process(range_limits = [0, 10000])

    ```
    - Use `load_to_memory=True` to improve processing time
    - And  `transfer_files_locally=True` transfers files to a local temporary folder improving significantly the processing time (to use when data is on server)

   b) (Shortcut) Use the module directly from command prompt as following:

    Make sure to be in the module directory ('.../CL61_module/').

      ```bash
      python module.py --data-folder "/path/to/your/data" --start-time "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss" --end-time "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss" --range [min range, max range]
      ```

      #### Options:

      - `--data-folder`: Path to the data folder. Default is `X:\common\03_Experimental\Instruments\EERL_instruments\5. Remote sensing\CL61_Ceilometer\Data`.

      - `--start-time`: Start date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`. Default is `2023-02-22 00:00:00`.

      - `--end-time`: End date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`. Default is `2023-02-23 00:00:00`.

      - `--min-range`: Measurement range (height) minimum limit `min_range` for plots. Can go from 0 to 15000 m. Default is `0`

      - `--max-range`: Measurement range (height) maximum limit `max_range` for plots. Can go from 0 to 15000 m. Default is `15000`

      - `--load-to-memory`: Flag to indicate whether to load data into memory. Default is `False`.

      - `--transfer-files-locally`: Flag to indicate whether to transfer files into a local temp folder. Default is `False`.

      #### Example:

      ```bash
      python module.py --data-folder "../Data_samples" --start-time "2023-02-22 12:00:00" --end-time "2023-02-23 12:00:00" --range [500,10000]
      ```

   This example will process data from the specified data folder, starting from the given start time to the end time, and within the specified height range.
