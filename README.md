# Vaisala CL61 Ceilometer Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is a master's student project aimed at analyzing and processing data collected from a Vaisala CL61 ceilometer. The project focuses on understanding and interpreting atmospheric data for various applications, such as weather monitoring, climate research, or environmental studies.

## Project Structure

The project folder is structured as follows:

- `CL61_module/`: This directory contains the Python module responsible for processing and analyzing data from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer. It includes relevant configuration files and module-specific code.

- `Data_samples/`: Sample of data obtained from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer are stored here. These data files are used as input for analysis and processing in the Python module.

- `Outputs/`: Output files generated by the analysis process are saved here. This can include visualizations, reports, and processed data for further use.

- `tests/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts used for testing and analyzing the module's functionality. It serves as a workspace for experimentation and research.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Explore the `CL61_module/` directory to understand the module's functionality and configuration.

4. Use the data files in the `Data/` directory to run analysis and processing with the provided Python module or scripts in the `tests/` directory.

5. Review the project's documentation and comments in the code to understand how to use the module effectively.

## Project Goals

- Understand and interpret data from the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer.

- Develop a Python module for data analysis and processing.

- Generate meaningful insights and visualizations from the data.

- Create a structured project that facilitates further research and experimentation.
